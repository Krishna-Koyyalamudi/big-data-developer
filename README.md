# Krishna Sumanth
## Current
I am a member of Spring 2020 Batch in Masters of Applied Computer Science. I am currently working on the final semester of my program. This semester I have two courses, Big Data as well as Graduate Directed Project II led by Dr. Denise Case. I have been working as a Graduate Assistant for Advanced Topics in Database Systems under Dr. Zhengrui Qin since the fall semester.

## Background
I am from India and I am an Electronics and Communication Engineer who had worked previously as Systems Engineer at Infosys Ltd back there. I have done my under graduation in Electronics and communication with minors in computer science and electives being entrepreneurship at Lovely Professional University (India).

## Plans
 I am tech enthusiast and I want my work/career to be in a field where I create new technology. I am into some distinct areas like Virtual/Augmented Reality, High Performance Computing and Computer Networking.

## Aside
 I don't know whether anyone finds it interesting but I understand how technology works at all levels (to the fundamentals of silicon) and I am good at quantitative analytics.
